# After the Harvest Weekly Gleaning Report

The Weekly Gleaning Report App was built to streamline the creation of reports that help to direct field supervisors overseeing gleaning events for After the Harvest. The Kansas City nonprofit organization After the Harvest schedules volunteers to glean food from local farm fields that are distributed to local pantries. Gleaning is the process of hand-picking produce that has been left in a field after the harvest; the produce is a viable food source that otherwise would be left in the field instead of providing wholesome produce to the targeted consumer. These flexible reports bring together relevant data from After the Harvest saving time and effort for the staff.

This app uses React, Redux, Express, Passport, and PostgreSQL (a full list of dependencies can be found in `package.json`).


## Download (Don't Clone) This Repository

- Don't Fork or Clone. Instead, click the `Clone or Download` button and select `Download Zip`.
- Unzip the project and start with the code in that folder.
- Create a new GitHub project and push this code to the new repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [PostrgeSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)

## Google API Setup Instructions
Google API access depends on having a Gmail account. If you have a Google account, go to console.developers.google.com and create a new project. Give it a title, and click "Create" to create a Google app. The user type should be configured as internal, (unless you have a GSuite account, in which case you can create an internal application.) You will need to enable the Google Docs API from the API Library with permission to read and write files, and extend scope to include access to Google Docs. From the developer console, Clicking on "Create Credentials" will give you access to Client ID, Client Secret, and API key. From this page, you should also define authorized JS origins and authorized redirect URLs. Our project uses a localhost port for both, and we recommend using http://localhost:3000.
 
Once you have established a client ID and client secret, create a .env file at the root of your project. Your client ID should be entered into your .env file as:
 
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID= Your client ID
REACT_APP_CLIENT_SECRET= Your client secret



## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
  ```
  SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
  ```
  While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm run server`
- Run `npm run client`
- Navigate to `localhost:3000`


## Debugging

To debug, you will need to run the client-side separately from the server. Start the client by running the command `npm run client`. Start the debugging server by selecting the Debug button.

Then make sure `Launch Program` is selected from the dropdown, then click the green play arrow.

## Testing Routes with Postman

To use Postman with this repo, you will need to set up requests in Postman to register a user and login a user at a minimum.

Keep in mind that once you using the login route, Postman will manage your session cookie for you just like a browser, ensuring it is sent with each subsequent request. If you delete the `localhost` cookie in Postman, it will effectively log you out.

1. Start the server - `npm run server`
2. [Import the sample routes JSON file](./PostmanPrimeSoloRoutes.json) by clicking `Import` in Postman. Select the file.
3. Click `Collections` and `Send` the following three calls in order:
   1. `POST /api/user/register` registers a new user, see body to change username/password
   2. `POST /api/user/login` will login a user, see body to change username/password
   3. `GET /api/user` will get user information, by default it's not very much

After running the login route above, you can try any other route you've created that requires a logged in user!

## Production Build

Before pushing to Heroku, run `npm run build` in terminal. This will create a build folder that contains the code Heroku will be pointed at. You can test this build by typing `npm start`. Keep in mind that `npm start` will let you preview the production build but will **not** auto update.

- Start postgres if not running already by using `brew services start postgresql`
- Run `npm start`
- Navigate to `localhost:5000`

## Lay of the Land

- `src/` contains the React application
- `public/` contains static assets for the client-side
- `build/` after you build the project, contains the transpiled code from `src/` and `public/` that will be viewed on the production site
- `server/` contains the Express App

This code is also heavily commented. We recommend reading through the comments, getting a lay of the land, and becoming comfortable with how the code works before you start making too many changes. If you're wondering where to start, consider reading through component file comments in the following order:

- src/components
  - App/App
  - Footer/Footer
  - Nav/Nav
  - AboutPage/AboutPage
  - InfoPage/InfoPage
  - UserPage/UserPage
  - LoginPage/LoginPage
  - RegisterPage/RegisterPage
  - LogOutButton/LogOutButton
  - ProtectedRoute/ProtectedRoute

## Deployment

1. Create a new Heroku project
1. Link the Heroku project to the project GitHub Repo
1. Create an Heroku Postgres database
1. Connect to the Heroku Postgres database from Postico
1. Create the necessary tables
1. Add an environment variable for `SERVER_SESSION_SECRET` with a nice random string for security
1. In the deploy section, select manual deploy

## Update Documentation

Customize this ReadMe and the code comments in this project to read less like a starter repo and more like a project. Here is an example: https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2
